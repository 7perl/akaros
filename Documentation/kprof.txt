The kprof devices samples the kernel IP at 1 Khz. 

You have to bind into /net for now as 9namespace doesn't yet control /dev.

bind -a '#K' /net

set up your world.

echo start > /net/kpctl

run your tests

echo stop > /net/kpctl

get the data
cat /net/kpdata > some-file

The file should probably NOT be on the akaros node, funnel it out over a mnt
or similar path to a persistent place where you can run tools.

The data is in this form
pc name count-in-milliseconds
The format is
%016llx %29s %016llx\n

The pc is 8-byte aligned. You'll see the function name a lot. You might want to reduce the
number of times you see it.

One way to process:

awk '{
> kp[$3]++;
> }
> END{
> for (var in kp)
> print var, " ", kp[var]
> }
> ' kp.txt

Oh, and, currently, we tend to assume that the pc is a kernel pc. That's kind of dumb, and
we need to fix it.
